This is a robot that anyone can build on the kitchen table. You don't need a 3D printer. You don't need special tools. You don't need a workshop. But you do need a soldering iron to build the circuit.

I've also included a gait (stepping pattern) generator Windows program. It's difficult to program walking robots and the Windows program should simplify creating Arduino sketches.

Although this Instructable describes a specific robot, I'm trying to explain how to design walking robots in general and to encourage you to design and build your own.

The project requires an Arduino Nano (or Uno or ProMini), 12 or 13 servos, a battery pack of some sort, around 100gm of Polymorph and maybe some bamboo skewers. For programming, you'll need a PC and a USB cable. Other than the soldering iron and a screwdriver you only need the implements you find in a kitchen.
